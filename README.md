# Stepper Synth

A multi-mode synth for retro emulation consoles running knulli/batocera. It supports multiple [synth engines](#synth-engines) and [effects](#effects) to get different sounds. (Any effect can be applied to any synth-engine.) It also has a global LFO to modulate any of the many parameters of the synth engine or the effect.

## Synth Engines

- Organ synth (like a digital Hammond B3)
- Subtractive synth (standard subtractive synth with a Moog style ladder low-pass filter)
- Sampler Synth (plays samples)
- Modelling Synth

## Effects

- Reverb
- Delay
